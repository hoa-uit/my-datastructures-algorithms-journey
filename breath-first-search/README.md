## Introduction

Breath-first-search is a technique to traverse a tree

Any problem involving to traversal of tree in level by level can leverage this technique

We use queue to keep track all of nodes in each level before we jump onto the next level

=> this means space complexity of algorithm is O(W) with W is the maximum number of nodes on any levels
