## what is graph?

graph is a data structure that contains collections of nodes (as vertices). and each node can be connected with each other by
an edge.

it is used for representative of a relationship between objects or entities in real life like a network of destination, social network, or neutral network. and many other use cases.

most used:
- finding shortest path or cycled graph

## type of graph

- undirected graph: a graph with its edges has no direction. Ex: social network is an undirected graph
- directed graph: in contrast with the previous one. ex: web page graph has a link to another page
- weighted graph: a graph in which edges have cost or weight associated with them. ex: road network has weight to represent the distance between 2 different places
- unweighted graph: social network
- complete graph: each vertex is connected to every other vertex in graph. ex: tournament football league. every two team will meet each other
- tree: it is connected graph that has no cycle in it
- connected graph: will always has a path that contains all the nodes in graph

## some popular algo with graph
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra
- Topological sort
